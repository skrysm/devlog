  Adds support for rendering blockquotes as alerts.

  See also: https://gohugo.io/render-hooks/blockquotes/#alerts

  NOTE: While this variant is not as elegant as custom containers (https://github.com/xoofx/markdig/blob/master/src/Markdig.Tests/Specs/CustomContainerSpecs.md; not supported
    by Hugo anyway) because you need to prefix every line with a "> ", this style is supported by GitHub and others. This is also why we prefer this variant over the previously
    used variants (shortcodes and code blocks). It's also better than code blocks because Markdown editors allow for syntax highlighting within the alerts.
