[.NET](https://dot.net) is a framework for building applications. It's mainly programmed with [C#](/topics/csharp). There are two variants: The **.NET Framework** which is the legacy, closed-source framework only supported on Windows. And **.NET Core (or just .NET)** which is the new, open-source, cross-platform framework.
