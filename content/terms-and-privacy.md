## Privacy Policy

This site:

* doesn't use cookies.
* doesn't do any kind of tracking or analytics.
* doesn't store, share, or sell any data about you.
* doesn't use/integrate third-party websites.

If you ever find that this is no longer the case, then this is most certainly a bug. Please [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/skrysmanski/docs/issues). Thank you.

Like with most privacy policies, I reserve the right to change/modify it anytime without notice (mainly because I am *not* collecting the data that would allow me to notify everyone).
