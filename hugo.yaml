# Make URLs to pages "../my-page.html" instead of "../my-page/".
# I personally like this better because it better transports that you're
# looking at a single page (rather than a directory). It also reduces
# the complexity of the file layout when publishing the site.
#
# SIDE NOTE: I'd personally love "../my-page" (i.e. without trailing slash)
#   but the Hugo dev's don't seem to be willing to make this work:
#   https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/7458#issuecomment-699049286
#
# NOTE: I tried to make "../my-page" URLs working with .htaccess and URL rewrite.
#   Unfortunately, I couldn't get this working properly - especially in cases where
#   there is a folder ("/tags/") and a file ("/tags.html") with the same base name.
#   Opening "/tags" would always resolve to "/tags/" instead of staying "/tags".
#   In the end, it was just too much fuss.

# Permalinks
#
# NOTE: I once tried to use a flat (i.e. Wikipedia like) URL structure but this turned
#   out to be too much hassle as most programming concepts apply to multiple programming
#   languages and thus most articles would need to be prefixed with the folder name anyway
#   (e.g. "dotnet/dotnet-simple-mutex.md" instead of "dotnet/simple-mutex.md"). So I dropped
#   this configuration and reverted to Hugo's default configuration.

  # 2. If they're not defined, uses the date of the last/latest Git commit for the file (see: https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/#configure-dates).
  # 3. Uses ":fileModTime" for new files (that don't have been commit yet and thus have not git date) - or else they'll have "1 Jan 0001" as date.
