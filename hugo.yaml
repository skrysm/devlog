    Hi. I'm Sebastian, software developer from Europe. On this site I write about topics that I've explored over time and want to remember -
    mostly related to software development. And hopefully, some of them may be interesting or helpful to you.

  # Prevent greedy lawyers from using Google to find images to sue you.
  robots: noimageindex

#
# Enable pretty URLs (i.e. use "../my-page/" instead of "../my-page.html").
#
# NOTE 1: This is required or else images in page bundles won't work properly. If this
#  setting was "true", the page itself would be located in the parent(!) folder of the images.
#  If this is "false", the page is located in the same(!) folder as the images.
#
# NOTE 2: There's quite some .htaccess mod_rewrite magic to make sure we trim the
#  trailing slash of URLs (which, unfortunately, is something the Hugo dev team doesn't seem to
#  be willing to support: https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/7458#issuecomment-699049286)
#
uglyURLs: false

#
# Permalinks
#
# NOTE: I once tried to use a flat (i.e. Wikipedia like) URL structure but this turned
#   out to be too much hassle as most programming concepts apply to multiple programming
#   languages and thus most articles would need to be prefixed with the folder name anyway
#   (e.g. "dotnet/dotnet-simple-mutex.md" instead of "dotnet/simple-mutex.md"). So I dropped
#   this configuration and reverted to Hugo's default configuration.

  topic: topics

frontmatter:
  # Defines the date of each page.
  # 1. Uses the front matter fields "publishDate" and "date" first (see: https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/).
  # 2. If they're not defined, uses the date of the last/latest Git commit for the file (see: https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/#configure-dates).
  # 3. Uses ":fileModTime" for new files (that don't have been commit yet and thus have not git date) - or else they'll have "1 Jan 0001" as date.
  date: ['publishDate', 'date', ':git', ':fileModTime']
  # Make "publishDate" behave the same way as "date" (there shouldn't be a difference between these two).
  # NOTE: By default, "publishDate" does NOT inherit its value from "date". So this config must actually be present.
