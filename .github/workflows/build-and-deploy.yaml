# GitHub Actions workflow: Builds the site and uploads it to the target server.

# For more details on workflows, see README.md.

name: Build and Deploy

# When to run this workflow
#
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on
#
# TIP: Don't use "schedule" triggers as this will cause the workflow to be disabled after 60 days of inactivity
#   (and afterward the workflow must be manually reenabled).
on:
  # Trigger the workflow on push to the main branch (deploy to production).
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      # NOTE: The preview branch is for tests without pull request (as GitHub Action sometimes work differently for pushes
      #   and pull requests).
      - preview
  # Trigger the workflow for any pull requests (deploy to preview, if "local" PR; don't deploy if PR from fork).
  pull_request:
  # Allow manual run of this workflow (https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/manually-running-a-workflow)

# Permissions for GITHUB_TOKEN for this workflow.
#
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token
#
# NOTE: Because we run with minimal permissions, we use "@vX" (instead of "@hash") for non-GitHub steps below.
#   Usually you would use "@hash" as a security measure to pin a specific version. However, since we run with
#   minimal permissions here, malicious code can't do much harm (most likely). For more details, see:

  # The Hugo version to use: https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases
  # NOTE: It sometimes happens that new Hugo versions break the site. So I've decided to always
  #   "pin" the Hugo version (instead of using the latest version). This way, the Hugo version
  #   can be updated with a pull request where I can test the new version.

  #   before pushing the result to production!!!
