Proof-read this file.

Audience: mid-level software developers.

Goals:
1. Fix spelling/grammar - use US English; improve clarity and conciseness; keep the author's voice and intent.
2. Preserve Markdown formatting; avoid extra blank lines; keep numbered lists as "1."; keep " - " spacing inside sentences; don't replace "-" with "—"; never change the text inside "[]" for Markdown links.
3. Leave code blocks/commands/config untouched unless incorrect; keep contractions.
4. Fact-check: only flag statements that look wrong or need a citation - don't list correct facts.

Output: Apply edits directly.
